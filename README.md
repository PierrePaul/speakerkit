# speakerkit
My public speaking kit for events organizers.

It contains the [full](biography-long-EN.md) and [short](biography-short-EN.md) (tweet like) version of my biography in English. There are also many size of my official picture in the [pictures folder](pictures/). Lastly, but not last, a list of talks I can give separated by topics in the [abstracts folder](abstracts/).

If you want to see previous talks I gave, check my [speaking page](https://outofcomfortzone.net/speaking/).
